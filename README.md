# Home Automation Project Documentation

This repository documents the planned transition from an old **Nikobus** system to a modern **KNX** home automation setup for an apartment. It details the new component selections, room-specific configurations, and a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM).

A key finding during the planning process was the discovery that the existing bus cabling, previously used for Nikobus, is fortunately **KNX-certified (J-Y(St)Y)**. This allows for a direct system upgrade without the need for extensive rewiring.

The documentation also includes installation notes, compatibility checks for Gira inserts with MDT frames, and image references for the chosen hardware.
